# Aggie Makerspace PrinterQueue

This program is designed to take input from a user and build a queue for the 3D printer. It will take the users personnel information as well as an stl file path.

## How to Add a Print Job
- Select "Add Print Job" and fill out all fields. If user has no previously requested a print, they will have to add a student profile.
- The .stl file will be copied to the stls directory that is available on the desktop.

## Working with a Print Job
- When a Print Job is completed, you should move it to Ready For Pickup and contact the user who requested it, either by email or text message.
- When the Print Job has been picked up, move it to Completed.
- To add comments about the print, for example, if it is delayed, or fails, or needs adjustments, open the Print Job, add comments to the "Print Comments" section, and save comments.
